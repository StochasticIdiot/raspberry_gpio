# raspberry_gpio
Simple library written in C++ to access Raspberry Pi GPIO.

This library was created as a learning project with the main goal of better understanding hardware access at register level (while also learning more about linux, git and github).
In case you are looking for an easy way to access Raspberry Pi GPIO you may take a look at other, more complete and reliable, libraries such as [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/) or [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO) python module.
